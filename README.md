### Weather Balloon

A little project to learn about APIs ([Dark Sky](https://developer.forecast.io/)'s,
in particular), parsing command-line arguments, putting an unreasonable amount of
emoji in a command-line program, "because it makes me gleeful"-driven
development, and whatever other interesting things I discover.
